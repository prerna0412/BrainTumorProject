#  Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification

This project uses deep learning (CNN and Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2) to classify brain MRI images into four categories:

- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

---

## Objective

To build and deploy an AI-powered classification tool that helps in medical diagnostics by predicting the type of brain tumor from MRI scans.

##  How to Run the App

###  Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed. Then open terminal/command prompt and run:


###  Step 2: Launch the App


or simply double-click on `Run_Tumor_App.bat` if you are on Windows.

## Model Details

- **CNN**: A custom Convolutional Neural Network was trained from scratch.
- **Transfer Learning**: MobileNetV2 was used to boost accuracy with pre-trained weights.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and loss were used to evaluate performance.
- **Libraries Used**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Streamlit, Scikit-learn.

##  Sample Output

- Uploads an MRI image via the Streamlit app
- Classifies it into one of the four tumor types
- Displays prediction with confidence score
